Simulating my TSMC-USA-CHINA (effect on TSMC due to the geo-political tensions caused by USA and China) vensim model in R(tidyverse) using DeSolve.
The model is not complete and is not subject to generating correct results.

I used deSolve package to implement Euler's method for solving ODE's.

Simulation result using R with tidyverse.

The "BTC-USD.csv" was just an add-on I used for presentation purposes.
